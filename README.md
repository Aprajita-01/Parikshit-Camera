# Parikshit Thermal Imaging Camera

This repository contains the code used to interface with Parikshit's thermal imaging camera. The camera is a FLIR Tau2 model. It is can be interfaced through the command line. The code can be used to take snapshots recursively. The original github repo used exhibited unfixable errors, so a try-catch block is used recursively to keep imaging until the error is resolved.
